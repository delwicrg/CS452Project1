## Game Name: Shape Mania 

## Goal
 You are the octagon and your goal is to collect all 5 circles within 30 seconds, under  certain conditions by moving left, right, up, and down. However, beware of the tumbling red octagons! Crossing paths with these means immediate death. Anytime your hexagon touches a circle, rectangle, or square, it dissapears and you receive the effects associated with the object.  There are two different ways you can change your speed, one good and one bad. The triangles serve as powerups. By crossing paths with a triangle, your speed is increased. By crossing paths with a rectangle, you a are put in a five second time out in which your movement is paused. After the five seconds is up, you may resume movement. The circle is your main focus, each circle counts as 1 point. In order to win, you must get to 5 points before the 30 seconds is up without getting hit by a tumbling red octagon. The time remaining is displayed as "Game will end in:" with the seconds listed. Additionally, the score is below which is updated each time you gain a point. After the 30 seconds is up, your game status will display next to the score indicating whether you have won or lost. 

## Game Control
 You only have the power to control the movement of the hexagon, the biggest object on the canvas. The keys to control it are the following:
    a   : move left
    d   : move right
    w   : move up
    s   : move down
    ** You must press the corresponding key each time movement is desired, and moving beyond the canvas is not allowed **
